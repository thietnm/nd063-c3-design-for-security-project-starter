Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1

In S3 setup we do not have any encryption configuration, so anyone can access and read data in them.

# Poor practice 2
The policy of IAM instance is InstanceRolePolicy-C3 which does not restrict any action to S3, which is a violation of the least privilege principle.
